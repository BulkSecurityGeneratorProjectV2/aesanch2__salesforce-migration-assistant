    The plugin does not make any attempt to obfuscate or encrypt the password that you enter. It will be shown in
    plaintext in the build.xml file that is generated. This should not be of concern if your hosting service is secure.
    However, if you do not want to supply your password to the plugin, leave this field blank and specify the password
    in the Ant build step under properties in the traditional manner (e.g. <tt>sf.password=PASSWORD</tt>).
